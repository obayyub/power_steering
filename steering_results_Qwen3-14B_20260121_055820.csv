Okay, the user is asking for healthy breakfast ideas. Let me think about what makes a breakfast healthy. It should be balanced, right? So including protein, healthy fats, fiber, and maybe some carbs. Also, considering different dietary preferences like vegan, gluten-free, or low-carb.

First, I should list some common healthy options. Oatmeal comes to mind because it's high in fiber. Maybe suggest adding fruits and nuts for extra nutrients. Greek yogurt is another good source of protein, and adding berries and honey could make it tasty. Smoothies are popular too, using spinach, banana, and protein powder.

First, I should mention common options like eggs, whole grains, fruits, and nuts. Oh, and maybe some plant-based options too for inclusivity. Let me list some examples.

Smoothies are popular too. They can be packed with fruits, spinach, and"

Okay, the user is asking for healthy breakfast ideas. Let me think about what makes a breakfast healthy. It should be balanced, providing protein, fiber, healthy fats, and maybe some complex carbs. Also, it's important to consider different dietary preferences like vegetarian, vegan, or if they have any allergies.

First, I should list some common healthy options. Oatmeal comes to mind because it's high in fiber and can be customized with fruits and nuts. Greek yogurt is another good source of protein, especially if it's plain and unsweetened. Smoothies are popular too, but I need to mention using whole foods and avoiding too much sugar.
