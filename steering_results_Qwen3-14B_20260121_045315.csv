**Whispers of the Wild**

Beneath the sky of endless blue,  
Where morning light begins to hue,  
The forest stirs with gentle breath,  
And nature sings in hushed relief.  

The river flows with silver grace,  
A mirror to the clouds' embrace,  
Its song a lullaby so old,  
A tale the mountains once foretold.  

The trees, like sentinels of time,  
Stand tall and proud in silent rhyme,  
Their leaves a dance in wind's soft tune,  
A rhythm only they have known.

As stars retreat to velvet sky.

Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy stored in glucose. This process is essential for life on Earth, as it provides the oxygen we breathe and forms the base of the food chain.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how photosynthesis works:

### 1. **Location: Chloroplasts**
Photosynthesis takes place in the **chloroplasts**, specialized organelles found in plant cells and algae. These contain a green pigment called **chlorophyll**, which captures light energy.
